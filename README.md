> The Simple Calculator project is a coursework project I did while pursuing The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full-stack Developer Certification. It is a web application that provides a clean and intuitive user interface and it is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These are the languages I used:
> 1. HTML
> 2. CSS
> 3. JavaScript
